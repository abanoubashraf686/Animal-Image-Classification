# Animal Image Classification Using Neural Networks üêæ

This project focuses on classifying images of 18 different animals using deep learning architectures. It is a hands-on project where we learned, experimented, and fine-tuned models to achieve high accuracies. Our efforts won **1st place** in the Kaggle course competition at our university.

## Dataset üì¶

Since the original dataset was small, we collected additional images from multiple sources to cover the same 18 animals.  

**Sources:**
- [Animal Image Dataset (90 Different Animals)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/animal-image-dataset-90-different-animals)  
- [Sea Animals Image Dataset üåä](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vencerlanz09/sea-animals-image-dataste)  
- [Different types of Animals Labeled Image Datasets | images.cv](https://images.cv/dataset-categories/animals)  

**Dataset Stats:**  
- Total images after removing duplicates: **30,657**  
- Training: 21,459  
- Validation: 6,438  
- Test: 2,760  

**Classes:**  
- Total Number of Classes: **18**  
- Class Names:  
  `beaver, butterfly, cougar, crab, crayfish, crocodile, dolphin, dragonfly, elephant, flamingo, kangaroo, leopard, llama, lobster, octopus, pigeon, rhino, scorpion`

## Architectures Used üèóÔ∏è

We experimented with the following deep learning models:  

1. **Inception V3**

## Accuracies üìä

| Model          | Inception V3 | ResNet 50 | ResNet 152 | MobileViT |
|----------------|--------------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Training Acc   | 98.18%       | 93.4%     | 93.8%      | 72.6%     |
| Validation Acc | 98.76%       | 94.25%    | 94.5%      | 72.7%     |
| Test Acc       | 98.66%       | 93.26%    | 94.6%      | 72.4%     |
| Pretrained     | Yes          | Yes       | Yes        | No        |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è For MobileViT, we stopped training despite it learning well without overfitting due to time constraints.
